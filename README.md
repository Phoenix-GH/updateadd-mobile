## Get Started

### 1. System Requirements

* Globally installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* Globally installed [react-native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)


### 2. Installation

On the command prompt run the following commands

```sh
$ git clone -b RN https://github.com/clearsummit/react-native-starter-project.git

$ cd react-native-starter-project/

$ npm install
  or
  yarn
```

### Run on iOS

*	Run `react-native run-ios` or `yarn ios` in your terminal

### Run on Android

*	Run `react-native run-android` or `yarn android` in your terminal

### Renaming the App

You've cloned the project and you're wanting to make it your own.  
With one command, [React Native Rename](https://github.com/JuneDomingo/react-native-rename) will replace all files, directories and references to what ever you'd like.

### Integrate [CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)

* Create an app on [ClearSummit's Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/apps) to get deployment keys. We should have a separate app for iOS and Android.

* iOS: [muti-deployment testing doc](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/multi-deployment-testing-ios.md) Do step 9.

* Android: [muti-deployment testing doc](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/multi-deployment-testing-android.md) Do step 2.
